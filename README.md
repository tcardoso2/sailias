# sailias
a [Sails v1](https://sailsjs.com) application

My own implementation of a Sails web-site boilerplate, but with additional generic features.  


* v 0.2.4:  Testing out generators (WIP) and documenting these under ./bin/sailias/; creating custom generator (WIP) roles;  
* v 0.2.3:  Small updates, mainly on configuration files (e.g. lint, less, sailsrc...);  
* v 0.2.2:  Finished Add-user page; First user signing up on the Users collection becomes automatically the Super Admin of the site;  
* v 0.2.1:  Added Add-user page, started working on Adding users (WIP). Added info on users page if user is Super Admin. Only Super Admins can remove other users; added Portuguese Locale file;  
* v 0.2.0:  Separated into Sailias public repo;  
* v 0.1.10: Implemented 'soft' removal of user in DB. Need to restrict to only Admin (High priviledged users), and to also be able to add other users;  
* v 0.1.9:  User Removal page now showing relevant user, remaining task is to work on the actual removal (WIP);  
* v 0.1.8:  Users page listing done, starting to work on removing user action (WIP);  
* v 0.1.7:  WIP on Users page;  
* v 0.1.6:  Started adding stubs for new pages (WIP): Users, Messages, Integration Points;  
* v 0.1.5:  Installation of sails-mongo as ORM choice;  
* v 0.1.4:  Added Sails.js backend app, aim is to use it to manage integration points (wip);  

* What's missing:
  - Adding automated tests;
  - Dynamic menu
  - Some setting pass to DB?
