# sailias
a [Sails v1](https://sailsjs.com) application

My own implementation of a Sails web-site, but with additional features.  

* v 0.2.0:  Separated into Sailias public repo;  
* v 0.1.10: Implemented 'soft' removal of user in DB. Need to restrict to only Admin (High priviledged users), and to also be able to add other users;  
* v 0.1.9:  User Removal page now showing relevant user, remaining task is to work on the actual removal (WIP);  
* v 0.1.8:  Users page listing done, starting to work on removing user action (WIP);  
* v 0.1.7:  WIP on Users page;  
* v 0.1.6:  Started adding stubs for new pages (WIP): Users, Messages, Integration Points;  
* v 0.1.5:  Installation of sails-mongo as ORM choice;  
* v 0.1.4:  Added Sails.js backend app, aim is to use it to manage integration points (wip);
